# Storyboard Project

This is a C++ project named "Storyboard". The project is set up with Visual Studio.

This is a simple command line application that allows users to add and search notes.
The application consists of two classes: Note and Storyboard.
The Note class represents a single note with a title, text, and tags.
The Storyboard class manages a collection of notes and provides methods to add and search notes.
The application is tested with hardcoded notes and search tests.

## Building the Project

To build the project, you can use the build task configured in Visual Studio Code. This task is defined in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file and uses the `cl` command to compile the C++ code.

To run the build task, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type "Run Build Task", and press Enter.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the resulting executable (`storyboard.exe`) from the command line or from within Visual Studio Code.
